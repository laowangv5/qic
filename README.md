# qic - Query In Console or Command line

JSON/YAML/XML comand line query tool with support of interactive mode.

By design, it only process a few common situations and there's a lot compromise which may need some attention.  It's not intending to embed a fully working syntax/sementic engine and only provide a few "sugar" features.   For too complicated situation, other than introducing very long single line expression, please try  code blocks where you can use any python syntax.
